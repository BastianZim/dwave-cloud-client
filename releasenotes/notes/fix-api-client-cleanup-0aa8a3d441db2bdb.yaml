    Add context manager protocol support to
    ``dwave.cloud.api.client.DWaveAPIClient`` to ensure resources are easily
    cleaned up (session closed). Note that ``close()`` method is available for
    cases when context manager pattern is inconvenient.

    Similarly, we add ``close()`` method to resources in
    ``dwave.cloud.api.resource.*``, in addition to the existing context manager
    protocol support.
