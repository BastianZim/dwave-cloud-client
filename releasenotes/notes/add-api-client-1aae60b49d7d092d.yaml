features:
  - |
    A low-level ``dwave.cloud.api.client`` added to abstract SAPI communication
    details (like authentication, response decoding, error handling, retries,
    etc).
  - |
    All SAPI requests and responses modelled in ``dwave.cloud.api.models.*``.
    These models are used for data validation and representation.
  - |
    Added model-level interfaces to SAPI resources (in a REST sense),
    ``dwave.cloud.api.resources.Solvers`` and
    ``dwave.cloud.api.resources.Problems``.
  - |
    Added mock solver data generators.
  - |
    New layer of exceptions added in ``dwave.cloud.api.exceptions``. Base
    exception ``RequestError`` subclasses ``requests``'s exception and
    includes raw ``.response`` object, along with ``.error_msg`` and
    ``.error_code`` returned by SAPI.
upgrade:
  - |
    ``SAPIError`` exception is now just an alias for
    ``dwave.cloud.api.exceptions.RequestError``.
