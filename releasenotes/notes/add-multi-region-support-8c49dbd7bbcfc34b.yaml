features:
  - |
    Added multi-region support to ``dwave.cloud.Client``.

    New config option for region selection is called ``region``, and environment
    variable is called ``DWAVE_API_REGION``.

    New config option for specifying Metadata API endpoint URL is exposed as
    ``metadata_api_endpoint``.

    List of available regions available with ``dwave.cloud.Client.get_regions``.
upgrade:
  - |
    To access solvers in a non-default region (na-west-1), you can use the
    ``region`` config option and ``DWAVE_API_REGION`` environment variable.
  - |
    ``dwave.cloud.config.load_config`` used to return some minimal (but
    arbitrary) set of always-set options (set to ``None`` if undefined). Now it
    returns just the options set either in config file, environment, or kwargs.
